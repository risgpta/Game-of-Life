Simulating Game of Life

(DESKTOP VERSION ONLY)
Simulation:

Manual:-
Click on the cell to give it life or take back life. (Toggle clicks make cell alive or dead)
Click on "Next generation!" to manully move to further generations.

Recommended: Make manual patterns to find out how the population goes...
Either all population becomes dead later or oscillates(or forms a cycle of pattern) or remains still or moves in a particular direction(indefinitely)

Random:-
Click on "Generate random Population" to generate random pattern of population on grid. (Usually a lot of isolated cells die in the very next generation)
Click on "Loop over next generation" to continuosly generate new generations.


Click on "Remove all population" to clear the board. 

* Ideally, the board should be an infinite board

CODE:

Implemented using React JS(use of Hooks)
To run code-
npm install
